## 📌 Problem Statement
 
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

## 🎯 Objective

**ZenCue** is a smart, safe, and supportive AI-powered application designed specifically for neurodivergent children.
It addresses the challenges kids face in processing text, images, and audio by using **Groq's multimodal AI** to simplify and explain information, offer assistive voice/text chat, and provide personalized support.

It also gives parents a secure way to manage subscriptions through **OnchainKit (Base)** providing both trust and transparency.
